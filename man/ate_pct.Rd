\title{ATE in Percentage Points Under Subgroup Heterogeneity (Post-Estimation)}
\usage{
ate_pct(model, group_vars, truew = FALSE, groupsize = NULL, VC_model = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object with \code{coef()} and \code{vcov()} methods
(e.g., from \code{lm()}). The estimation sample is taken to be \code{model.frame(model)}.}

\item{group_vars}{Character vector of subgroup indicator variable names. These must
correspond to coefficient names in \code{coef(model)} and columns present in the model frame.}

\item{truew}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, treats subgroup weights as fixed/known
and sets the weight-variance component to zero.}

\item{groupsize}{Optional numeric vector of subgroup sizes \eqn{N_g}, one per element of
\code{group_vars} and in the same order. All values must be positive.
If supplied, weights are \eqn{w_g = N_g / \sum_h N_h} and \eqn{p_T = (\sum_g N_g)/N}.
\strong{Important:} \code{groupsize} should correspond to the same estimation sample
used to fit \code{model}.}

\item{VC_model}{Optional variance-covariance matrix for the fitted model coefficients.
If \code{NULL}, uses \code{vcov(model)}. Must be square and have row/column names
containing \code{group_vars}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"ate_pct"}: a list containing
\describe{

\item{\code{resvec}}{Concatenation \code{c(taubar, rho_a, rho_b, sd_taubar, sd_rho_a, sd_rho_b)}.}
\item{\code{G}}{Number of subgroups.}
\item{\code{w}}{Group weights \eqn{w_g} (sum to 1).}
\item{\code{N}}{Number of observations in the estimation sample.}
\item{\code{N_T}}{Total treated count used to construct weights (\eqn{N_T=\sum_g N_g}).}

\item{\code{tau}}{Subgroup log-point effects \eqn{\tau_g}.}
\item{\code{Sigma_tau}}{Estimated covariance matrix of \eqn{\tau}.}
\item{\code{Sigma_w}}{Estimated covariance matrix of \eqn{w} (zero if \code{truew=TRUE}).}

\item{\code{Sigma_delta}}{Block-diagonal covariance matrix of \eqn{(\tau,w)}.}

}
\description{
\code{ate_pct} is a post-estimation function for computing average treatment effects (ATEs)
in percentage points when treatment effects are heterogeneous across observable subgroups.

The function extracts subgroup-specific average log-point treatment effects \eqn{\tau_g}
(the coefficients on subgroup indicator variables) and their covariance matrix from a fitted
model, constructs subgroup weights \eqn{w_g}, and reports three ATE-in-percentage-points
functionals: \eqn{\bar{\tau}}, \eqn{\rho_a}, and \eqn{\rho_b}. Standard errors are computed
using delta-method formulas that account for estimation uncertainty in subgroup effects and,
when applicable, in subgroup weights.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{\tau = (\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_G)'} denote subgroup average log-point effects and
\eqn{w = (w_1,\ldots,w_G)'} subgroup weights with \eqn{\sum_g w_g = 1}. The reported targets are:
\describe{
\item{\code{taubar}}{\eqn{\bar{\tau} = \sum_g w_g \tau_g}.}
\item{\code{rho_a}}{\eqn{\rho_a = \exp(\bar{\tau}) - 1}.}
\item{\code{rho_b}}{\eqn{\rho_b = \sum_g w_g \exp(\tau_g) - 1}.}
}

\strong{Weights.}
If \code{groupsize} is supplied, weights are constructed as
\eqn{w_g = N_g / \sum_h N_h} where \eqn{N_g} are the supplied subgroup sizes.
Otherwise, \code{ate_pct} uses the model's estimation sample (via \code{model.frame(model)})
and counts treated observations in each subgroup indicator to form \eqn{N_g}.
When subgroup sizes are computed from the data, subgroup indicators must be 0/1 and
mutually exclusive in the estimation sample.

\strong{Inference.}
Standard errors are computed by the delta method. Weights are treated as estimated unless
\code{truew = TRUE}, in which case the weight-variance component is set to zero
(i.e., \eqn{\Sigma_w = 0}).

\section{Methods}{

The returned object supports \code{print()} and \code{summary()} methods:
\itemize{
\item \code{print.ate_pct}: prints estimates, standard errors, z-stats, and p-values.
\item \code{summary.ate_pct}: adds normal-approximation confidence intervals.
}
}

\examples{
## Suppose variables gr1, gr2, gr3 are indicators for three sub-treatment groups.
## We are interested in the ATE in percentage points of these three treatment groups.
## First run a semi-log regression with subgroup-specific treatment effects.
## (y must be log-transformed)
data(ate_pct_example, package = "atepct")
## Run the regression
reg_res <- lm(lny~x+gr1+gr2+gr3,data=ate_pct_example)

## Example 1: ATE in percentage points for three groups (weights by sample size)
out1 <- ate_pct(reg_res, c("gr1","gr2","gr3"))
out1
summary(out1)

## By default, ate_pct() uses vcov(reg_res) as the covariance matrix of tauhat.
## If you want heteroskedasticity-robust SEs for tauhat, use sandwich (if available):
if (requireNamespace("sandwich", quietly = TRUE)) {
  VChet <- sandwich::vcovHC(reg_res, type = "HC1")
  out1_robust <- ate_pct(reg_res, c("gr1","gr2","gr3"), VC_model = VChet)
  out1_robust
  summary(out1_robust)
}

## Example 2: weights are treated as fixed (no sampling variation).
## Also, use the conventional VC matrix for log points estimator.
out2 <- ate_pct(reg_res, c("gr1","gr2","gr3"), truew=TRUE)

## Example 3: ATE in percentage points for the first two groups,
## and assign equal weights (so weight are fixed and known.)
out3 <- ate_pct(reg_res, c("gr1","gr2"), truew=TRUE, groupsize=c(1,1))

## Example 4: Provide subgroup sizes externally.
## The command below is this is exactly the same as
## \code{ate_pct gr1 gr2 gr3}
## as 15, 24, 37 are the sample size for the three treatment groups.
out4 <- ate_pct(reg_res, c("gr1","gr2","gr3"), groupsize=c(15,24,37))
